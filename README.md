# Graph Coloring
## Project Description
Project Owca is a group project in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) at the Warsaw University of Technology. This project is a C application that allows users to create graphs and color them in such a way that no two connected vertices share the same color.
## Project Features:
* Graph Creation:
The application enables users to dynamically create graphs by adding vertices and edges as well as removing them.

* Graph Coloring:
After defining the graph, users can utilize the coloring algorithm, which assigns a color to each vertex, satisfying the condition that no two connected vertices have the same color.

## Technologies Used
* C
